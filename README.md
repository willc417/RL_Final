This repository contains the code for a study by Joel Afriyie and Will Clinton done in Fall 2019 for CS394R. 

*All code contained is written by Afriyie and Clinton except the Test files, which were adopted from assignments given in CS394R*

In the study, we analyze differences between on-policy and off-policy learning algorithms. We implement Sarsa(λ), Sarsaγ, Retrace(λ), and Retraceγ. 

To run the experiments, clone the repository and install gym, pandas, and matplotlib. Running the executable file "run_experiments.py" will train the algorithms over a certain amount of episodes and graph the reward values received during training as well as the maximum and minimum values received during evaluation.
